    <string name="help_info">Objective:\n\nFill every row, column, and 3x3 region of the grid with all of the 9 provided words. At the beginning of every game several cells will contain locked words, these cells will shape the solution of each puzzle and cannot be altered.\n\nHow to play:\n\nTo place a word in a cell, first click an empty cell, then click the desired translation from the scroll bar beneath the grid. After insertion, the text will be highlighted either red for an invalid placement, or blue for a valid placement. Note that a valid placement does not equate to correct placement, and may need to be replaced in order to solve the puzzle. Upon clicking any non-empty cell, the full word will be displayed at the top of the page, and all cells containing the same word will be highlighted.</string>
