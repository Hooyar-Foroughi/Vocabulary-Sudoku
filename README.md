# Vocabulary-Sudoku
### Vocabulary Sudoku is an educational Android game application for those who are learning new languages and enjoy solving Sudoku puzzles!
---

The basic idea of the Vocabulary Sudoku App is to replace the digits 1 through 9 of the typical Sudoku puzzle with nine pairs of words. Each pair of words consists of one word in the user's native language (say English), and one word in the language being studied (Spanish for this model).

In the *Listening Comprehension* game mode, words within grid cells will not be visible to users. Instead, the numbers 1 through 9 will be shown similair to a typical Sudoku puzzle, but when users click on a cell they will hear the word spoken to them and will be challanged to match the word with it's translation.
